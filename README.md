# poly-split-mod

## Synopsis

Algorithm that solves the problem of cutting a given polygon into any number of areas of given squares with a lines of minimal length.
Based on [Algorithm by Sumit Khetarpal](http://www.khetarpal.org/polygon-splitting/).
It works for both convex and concave polygons without self-intersected edges.
This code is a modification of the one developed by [Grabarchuk Viktor](https://github.com/dhmhd/poly-split).
